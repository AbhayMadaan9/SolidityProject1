# SolidityProject1
Introducing my latest project, a Lottery Application built using the Solidity programming language. This repository showcases my understanding of the fundamental concepts of the Solidity language and how to develop decentralized applications using Ethereum's blockchain.

The basic algorithm of the application allows users to participate in a lottery by submitting their own unique numbers. The winner is then chosen at random and is awarded the prize. The code is thoroughly commented, making it easy to understand for anyone who wants to learn from it or build upon it.

Take a look at the code and see for yourself the power of Solidity in building decentralized applications. Feedback and suggestions for improvements are always welcome

# Algo of project
1.participant must have wallet.
2.A participant can transfer ether more than one time but the transferred ether must be 2ether.
3.As the participant will transfer ether its address will be registered. 
4.Mnager will have full control over the lottery.
